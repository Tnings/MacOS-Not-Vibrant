# MacOS(Not)Vibrant

![Showcase img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tnings/MacOS-Not-Vibrant/main/Images/Pic.png)
MacOSVibrant is a one file firefox theme based on my MacOS only theme, MacOSVibrant. It is themed after apple apps, such as the music app but without the vibrancy effect so it can work on Linux and Windows. <br />

This theme allows you to use any theme you want with it to customize the colors, the one in the showcase is my theme [AppleStyledTheme 2](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/applestyledtheme-2/) <br />

This theme is based off of [ProtoVibrant](https://github.com/bpwned/protovibrant), and borrows code from [Simply Silver/Peach](https://github.com/CristianDragos/FirefoxThemes/tree/master/Simplify%20Silver%20Peach) for the tabs. <br />

If you find any bugs, or have a tweak you think could make MacOS(Not)Vibrant better, please make an issue and we can discuss it! <br />

I hope you enjoy this skin!
